# restaurant-menu-order-system
A console-based Python project that allows restaurant owners to add dynamic menu items (starters, main course, desserts) and lets customers place orders by selecting from the available items. It demonstrates the use of lists, functions, loops, and user input handling to simulate a simple restaurant ordering system.
